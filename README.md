#Dropwizard + XML
[Dropwizard](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard) extension for high performance processing of XML inputs and outputs

Uses:
* [Jackson XML Provider](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-jaxrs-xml-provider) for JAX-RS MessageBodyReader and MessageBodyWriter implementation
* [Jackson DataFormat XML](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml) for XMLMapper, equivalent to ObjectMapper in JSON
* [Woodstox](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/WoodstoxHome) for high performance XML processing under the hood
* [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) for the best of Ant plus Maven minus all the crap.

##Why
Dropwizard is fast, container-less and JSON is awesome. But understandably, XML files are deeply rooted into the IT ecosystem of many organisations. It would be great if the power and simplicity of Dropwizard to build XML RESTful web services, instead of relying on bloated frameworks and chunky application servers. That's what this project aims to do.

##Noteworthy
Dropwizard-xml is compatible with Dropwizard 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT and above only. Dropwizard 0.7 uses Jackson 2.2.3. The previous Dropwizard release uses Jackson 2.1.4 which contains a show stopper bug with XML unwrapped lists. See jackson-dataformat-xml
[ISSUE-58](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/58)

Certain configurations such as Indentation are switched on by default. Will attempt to make these configurable in the
future.

##Usage
Unfortunately there is no maven repository yet. For now, simply download the project, run gradle or gradle wrapper to compile and install to your local maven repository:

    gradlew install

To use the XML Provider, simply register it in your Application.Run() method:

    env.jersey().register(new JacksonXMLMessageBodyProvider(JacksonXML.newXMLMapper(), env.getValidator()));

Don't forget to annotate your Resources accordingly with XML mediatype:

    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML)
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML)

Sample project coming soon.
