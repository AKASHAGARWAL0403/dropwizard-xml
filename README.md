Dropwizard XML
==============

[Dropwizard](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard) extension using [Jackson JAX-RS XML Provider](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-jaxrs-xml-provider) to read and write XML files instead of JSON

While JSON is awesome, often times in the "enterprise" world such as banking institutions, XML is very much deeply rooted into the IT ecosystem. This project will leverage Jackson XML to make Dropwizard XML friendly and available to those working under corporate umbrellas.

Still work in progress. See example project for usage.
